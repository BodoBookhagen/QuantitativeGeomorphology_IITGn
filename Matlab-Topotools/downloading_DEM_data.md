# Downloading DEM data
There exist several sources of DEMs, with different quality and purposes. One of the most useful DEMs at a global scale is the SRTM DEM, because it is openly available and has seen lots of quality control.

## reprocessed SRTM - NASADEM
The SRTM data have been reprocessed and merged with ICESAT data for a continuous surface model. The Geoid has been adjusted and changed (so it aligns with the TanDEM-X DEM). This reprocessing has been initiated during the MEaSUREs project. The NASADEM is described [here](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/competitive-programs/measures/nasadem) with a more detailed [Guide to NASADEM](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/592/NASADEM_User_Guide_V1.pdf).

## HydroSHEDS
SRTM DEM has been adjusted and corrected for drainage networks and is available at the [HydroSHEDS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/) site. Vector files can be downloaded as well.

## Stereogrammetry from optical imagery
[ASTER GDEM V3](https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp) has been made publically available in August 2019.
